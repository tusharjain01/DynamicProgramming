## Getting Started ✨✨

👋👋 I am Tushar Jain.And welcome to my repository,where i will be uploading my codes on Dynamic programming (which is what i am currently learning🏫).Hope u enjoy my code and the comments which i have written within the codes👩‍💻.

## Folder Structure 📁

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
    - `targetsumsubet.java`
    - `painthouse.java`
    - `painthousemanyhouses.java`
    - `unboundedkanpsack.java`
    - `minimumcostpath.java`
    - `kanpsack01.java`
    - `goldmine.java`
    - `countencoding.java` --> This program required a lot of time ⏳⏳ to be learned properly.
    - `countabcsequence.java`
    - `countbinarystring.java`
    - `maximumsumnonadjacent.java` --> This progarm creates the basics of "Greedy".
    >Stair Problem
    -- Fun Fact : to go from n to n there is only one path d'not move.🐱‍🏍🤣🤦
    - `climbstair.java` --> This is basic problem when we start learnig Dynamic Programming.
    - `climbstairwithminimummoves.java`
    - `climbstairwithvariablejumps.java`
    >Learning the basics of permutation and combination
    -- Hint🥷 : if you want to create a combination put the tabulation array inside the coins array.
    - `coinchangecombination.java`
    - `coinchangepermutation.java`

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
